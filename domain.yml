  utter_FAQ-SVPquotes:
  - text: IM on Procurement does not mandate the need for 3 quotes.</br></br> However,
      assessment of the reasonableness of the price(s) quoted is still required. Assessment
      may be based on verbal or written quotes, recent purchases, suppliers' published
      rates, or any other source of reliable information (e.g. flyers, Internet, newspapers).
      You can also use GeBIZ Mall or call quotations through GeBIZ.
  utter_FAQ - awarding proposal with highest score for Price-Quality Evaluation:
  - text: Quotations/Tenders should only be awarded to the tenderer who obtains the
      highest score, and deviation should only be exercised if there are overriding
      considerations outside of the stated evaluation criteria (e.g. firm is facing
      litigation case which may be of relevance to the quotation/tender). Otherwise,
      we should recommend award to the tenderer with the highest score, so as to avoid
      accusation of favouritism and perception of bias.
  utter_FAQ - signing formal contract/agreement:
  - text: 'IM on Procurement does not mandate the signing of Formal Contract or Agreement
      after the Letter of Acceptance or LOA is issued to the successful tenderer.
      However, a Formal Contract or an Agreement is necessary when the procurement
      is complex or when the nature/scope of the works involved warrants it. This
      is to ensure that both parties have the same understanding on the documents
      that form the contract to prevent downstream disputes. Examples where a Formal
      Contract or an Agreement may be required: 1. High value complex projects (e.g.
      construction projects, consultancy projects, etc) 2. Many rounds of tender clarifications
      during evaluation 3. Goods/services to be delivered over a period of time (e.g.
      system development, term contracts, etc 4. Many items in Schedule of Rates 5.
      Many milestones/ deliverables involved'
  utter_FAQ - Sponsorship subject to IM:
  - text: No, Sponsorship is not subject to IM on Procurement.
  utter_FAQ - rules for giving honorarium:
  - text: An honorarium is a payment for a service which has been done ex gratia or
      which fees are not legally required. Since the payment is made without the giver
      recognising any liability or legal obligation (i.e. there is no contract between
      URA and the receiver), this is not considered procurement and would not be subject
      to the IM on Procurement rules and procedures.
  utter_FAQ - rules for giving honorarium_1:
  - text: The honorarium amount could be a token sum as a form of appreciation, or
      an amount to cover the necessary expenditure (e.g. hotel, air tickets) incurred
      by the speaker. While there are no guidelines on the IM with regard to the amount,
      individual agencies shall ensure there are adequate internal controls in place
      to approve the amount.
  utter_FAQ - rules for giving honorarium_2:
  - text: Please note that if URA choose to procure the speaker’s necessary accommodation
      and air tickets, procurement rules will apply for the procurement of the accommodation
      and air tickets.
  utter_FAQ - approval process honorarium:
  - text: 'All of the following conditions are to be met for honorarium: a) The party
      is providing the services out of goodwill (e.g. no fees/charges/favours requested)
      b) There is no intent to form a contractual relationship c) There will not be
      any agreement which will bind both parties legally d) The honorarium given is
      not agreed upon upfront'
  utter_FAQ - approval process honorarium_1:
  - text: Please put up an expenditure paper for the honorarium (which will require
      Fin's support) and address these conditions in your paper to provide proper
      justification for giving honorarium, including the quantum.
  utter_FAQ - considerations for proc of G+S:
  - text: Besides adherence to the 3 key principles, staff should also demonstrate
      socio-political sensitivity to public expectation on the usage of public funds,
      i.e. (i) we should not procure lavish, extravagant, or unnecessary products/services
      and indulge in wastage (ii) we should be mindful of the public’s perception
      of our purchases, e.g. paying a premium for a goods vis-à-vis a lower cost one
      which could also meet our requirements
  utter_FAQ - factors for proc of high-end G+S:
  - text: 'When the procurement is for niche or high-end products or services, the
      public could presumably misconstrued them as luxury and therefore you should
      exercise more caution and consider to: (i) re-examine the need for such products
      or services especially if the buy is a common product or service, e.g. chairs,
      booking of venue for conference, transport service, etc.; (ii) Search for alternatives,
      i.e. similar products or services which are more mid-range or alternative work
      solutions which can deliver similar outcome; (iii) In the event that (i) and
      (ii) cannot be fulfilled, you should prepare a cogent explanation for the procurement
      in anticipation of any queries from the public.'
  utter_FAQ - Conflict of Interest:
  - text: The guiding principle is that an officer's private interests should be separate
      from his public duties, and that there should be no conflict of interest between
      an officer's official position and his work, and his activities outside his
      official duties. When in doubt at any procurement stage, officers should declare
      any potential conflict of interest and inform their supervisors.
  utter_FAQ - using RFQ and not tenders:
  - text: A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a procurement approach to communicate outcome-based
      requirements and where the proposal that most closely fits the needs and budget
      is selected, or where it is not industry practice to tender for the items.
  utter_FAQ - using RFQ and not tenders_1:
  - text: While RFP allows for diversity in proposals submitted and for discussion
      and changes in scope, you must note that evaluation of proposals will be more
      challenging as you are not comparing like-for-like.  So for the straight forward
      buys, where requirements are standard and there is no need for innovation, tender
      is still the best method to employ.
  utter_FAQ - using RFQ and not tenders_2:
  - text: The same principles and procedure for calling tenders also apply to RFP.
  utter_FAQ - is purchase SVP if below $6000:
  - text: You need to check if there are any existing bulk tenders (e.g. in place
      before starting on procurement. This applies to all types and value of procurement,
      including SVP. SVPs are meant for low value one-off purchases that are not available
      from Demand Aggregation contracts (e.g. DSTA/ IDA Bulk Tender). Departments
      should exercise prudence and ensure that their expenditure on small value buys
      are reasonable.
  utter_FAQ - splitting purchase:
  - text: Generally, purchases should not be split into small quantities in order
      to avoid complying with the instructions under IM on Procurement. Where needs
      can be reasonably foreseen, you should plan purchases in advance and aggregate
      those of similar nature so as to benefit from economies of scale. If there is
      a recurring need for the purchase, departments should look into establishing
      a period contract.
  utter_FAQ - A14:
  - text: First, you should decide on the most appropriate approach - whether to “in-source”
      (engage another Government Agency) or “outsource”, based on factors such as
      efficiency and best value. If the decision is to ‘out-source’, the procurement
      rules would apply. In this instance, you shall not approach the Government Agency
      to participate in the tender/quotation as they should not be competing with
      private sector. If the decision is to “in-source”, it is considered as collaboration
      between Government Agencies which is not subject to procurement rules.
  utter_FAQ-A16:
  - text: Weightage for evaluation criteria should also be stated upfront in the tender
      documents so that all tenderers are aware what is important to us and bid on
      a level playing field.
  utter_FAQ-A15:
  - text: EPPU and BCA registrations do give indication on the financial capacity
      of the tenderers. No further financial evaluation will be required if that is
      adequate for your assessment. However, you are still free to request for further
      financial information if deemed necessary according to your risk threshold level
      for the particular tender.
  utter_Specify budget in tender docs:
  - text: IM is silent on whether you should specify the budget in your tender documents.
      There are pros and cons in doing so. Specifying a budget may cause suppliers
      to quote around your budget even though they are able to supply/deliver at a
      much better value. Not specifying the budget may attract a whole spectrum of
      bids, some or all of which are way beyond your budget. You will have to assess
      this while preparing your specifications.
  utter_FAQ-proc with EPV below $70,000:
  - text: Yes, a tender can also be used as a sourcing method for procurement with
      EPV below $70,000. The Quotation Approving Authority shall be the approving
      authority for Approved Procurement Value (APV) up to $80,000 in reference to
      IM on Procurement, Stage 4, FAQ 1.1.
  utter_FAQ-choosing between Direct Contracting and Limited Tender/Quotation:
  - text: Differences between these 2 approaches are summarised in the table. You
      will have to assess which approach is more appropriate for your purchase. Refer
      to Stage 2 - Determining Procurement Approach for details on how to seek approval
      for Limited Quotation/Tender or Direct Contracting.
  utter_FAQ-need min. opening period for tenderers invited to bid:
  - text: No, there is no minimum opening period for limited quotations or tenders
      but it is a good practice to provide at least 3 working days so that tenderers
      have sufficient time to prepare their tender submission. Please note that if
      the invited tenderers are not able to respond by the closing date, you would
      have to re-call the tender.
  utter_FAQ-Limited Tender for sensitive proc:
  - text: Unless the procurement qualifies for Limited Tender, open tender must be
      called. “Sensitive in nature” is not one such ground for Limited Tender. You
      need to pay extra attention to tender documents and to ensure that they are
      desensitised for public consumption. If the tender details are sensitive, you
      may consider not to publish the entire tender document in GeBIZ. Tenderers who
      are interested will need to collect the relevant tender documents containing
      the sensitive information from our premises. You may also consider asking tenderers
      to complete a “Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)” form before releasing the tender
      documents.
  utter_FAQ-proc procedure for cash vouchers:
  - text: Procurement principles apply to purchase of vouchers. Even though vouchers
      have a face value, they are not necessarily sold at face value. It is possible
      that merchants may sell these vouchers below face value at bulk volume discounts,
      or sell at face value but include non-price perks such as additional free vouchers
      or longer validity periods etc. Hence it is useful to compare these non-price
      elements as well.
  utter_changes allowed to tender in 2-stage tendering:
  - text: Generally, revisions made to the original tender (be it terms and conditions
      or requirements) should be fine-tuning in nature and should not be substantial
      such that it warrants a new tender to be called. It is not possible to have
      a guideline like changes should be limited to x% of the original tender. So
      you ought to state the scope of changes when seeking approval from CEO/DCEO
      before carrying out 2-Stage tendering.
  utter_FAQ-single bid for open quotation/tender:
  - text: 'You may award the single bid if you have: (i) Assessed that the proposal
      fully meets your requirements (ii) Assessed that the price submitted by the
      single bidder is reasonable (e.g. you may compare with past purchases, market
      rate etc) (iii) Ensured that the Specifications are not overly prescriptive
      such that they preclude competition (iv) Allowed sufficient time for suppliers
      to submit their bids (especially for complex tenders)  (v) Made effort to cultivate
      interest and encourage suppliers to participate in the quotation/tender after
      it has been published.  MND has mandated that clearance from CEO / DCEO is required
      to accept the single bid prior to award.'
  utter_more than 1 bid received but only 1 acceptable:
  - text: No, a single-bid situation is when only one bid is received in the quotation
      or tender. In the event your quotation/tender has two line items - one of the
      items only receives one bid while the other receives more than 1 bid, this is
      also not considered as a single bid.
  utter_FAQ-evaluation for late hardcopy tender submission:
  - text: Whether the hardcopy submission is late, you have to ensure that the acceptance
      of late hard copy submission does not give rise to unfair practices.  </br></br>
      You should consider whether the information submitted via the hardcopy submission
      affects the prices or the proposal submitted via GeBIZ. If the hardcopy submissions
      are merely supporting documents which contain factual information (e.g. financial
      statements), there should not be any concerns as tenderers are not able to modify
      the late submission to their advantage (e.g. to further refine their proposal
      with the additional time or after having knowledge of the bids published on
      GeBIZ).  </br></br> The best way to avoid such situation is to mandate a full
      electronic submission whenever possible.
  utter_FAQ-steps to take when recalling a tender:
  - text: 'You could consider: </br> (a) revising specifications to ensure they are
      broad enough to attract competition;</br> (b) lengthening the opening period
      of the tender or quotation; and/or</br> (c) alerting suppliers to the opportunity
      published on GeBIZ.'
  utter_FAQ-in Tender Evaluation Committee (TEC), have friend in bidding company:
  - text: You should flag out any conflict of interest or possible public perception
      of conflict of interest when submitting the tender evaluation and recommendation
      reports to Tenders Board for approval. This could include cases where related
      parties including ex-URA staff (who may be involved directly or indirectly in
      the formulation and preparation of the tenders/quotations earlier) are part
      of the bidding parties. If in doubt, you should flag out potential conflict
      of interests for Tenders Board information.   The same would apply for tenders
      to be submitted to MND’s Tenders Board for approval.
  utter_FAQ-approval for qualification of selective tenders:
  - text: Selective tender is a procedure where only suppliers satisfying the conditions
      for participation ("qualified suppliers") can submit a tender. It comprises
      2 stages – Pre-tender Qualification stage and the Tender cum Qualification stage.

      of selective tenders shall be approved by CEO.
  utter_FAQ-Purchase Order for tender proc if already have Letter of Acceptance:
  - text: Technically, only one type of contracting instrument is required for each
      procurement. However, if it is a period contract with downstream purchases,
      then a PO needs to be raised for such downstream purchases. The initial Letter
      of Acceptance was only to formalise the standing arrangement of the period contract
      at the upstream.
  utter_Purchase Orders(PO) to note:
  - text: The 2 most commonly used POs are:</br> a) e-Catalogue PO (e-cat PO)</br>
      b) Direct PO (DPO)</br></br>  E-Cat PO is PO generated as a result of period
      contracts which are formed via a quotation or tender. This should be used when
      you are raising a PO from an existing period contract, e.g. DSTA bulk tender
      for catering, URA term contract for printing. </br></br> DPO is a standalone
      PO which is not linked to any quotations/tenders. DPO should only be used for
      ad-hoc purchases which are not tied to any contracts or small value purchases
      not above $6,000, where necessary. You may refer to the Finance Circular Minute
      M20/2003 dated 13 May 2003 and any other relevant policies on when the GeBIZ
      Order (Direct) Module should be used.
  utter_FAQ-guideline for acceptable percentage of contract variation:
  - text: IM on Procurement is silent on the number of variations allowed per contract
      or the maximum value of variations allowed. However, it should also not result
      in substantial changes to the fundamental deliverables of the original contract.
      You will need to assess whether a variation, and at what quantum/terms, is the
      most advantageous.

  - text: IM on Procurement is silent on the number of variations allowed per contract
      or the maximum value of variations allowed. However, it should also not result
      in substantial changes to the fundamental deliverables of the original contract.
      You will need to assess whether a variation, and at what quantum/terms, is the
      most advantageous.
  utter_FAQ-assessing additional works:
  - text: Judgement is required in assessing whether the works constitute variations
      to the contract, or whether a new quotation/tender should be considered for
      the additional works. </br></br> Generally, new quotations/tenders should be
      considered if:</br> a) Scope of new works is outside the original scope of works
      of the contract.</br> b) Contract period is extended for too long.</br> c) Additional
      works are extensive or are of high value, as this may mean that the works are
      attractive enough for new suppliers to consider putting in bids. </br> d) Works
      are substantial and go beyond the Approved Procurement Value, as this may indicate
      that the original assumptions upon which the project was based are no longer
      valid.
  utter_FAQ-contract variation involves an increase in APV:
  - text: The new Estimated Procurement Value (EPV) is the estimated cost of the goods
      and services to be procured (e.g. estimated unit price x estimated quantity),
      including contingency amount, provisional sum and contract options, if any.
      See IM Procurement Stage 2, Rule 7.3 for details on how to derive <a href =

      need to seek approval from the relevant authority to incur expenditure based
      on the new EPV of $105,000. As the Approved Procurement Value (APV) is defined
      as the total sum, inclusive of contract options, possible contract extensions
      and contingencies put forward to the relevant Quotation Approving Authority
      (QAA) or Tender Approving Authority (TAA) for approval.">APV</span> has been
      increased, you also need to seek approval from Tenders Board based on the revised
      APV.
  utter_FAQ-novation request from existing contractor:
  - text: Novation is often the result of changed circumstances midway through the
      contract e.g. mergers and acquisitions, financial difficulties, sale of a part
      of the business or inability to fulfil contractual obligations. If the existing
      contractor is unable to carry on with the works satisfactorily, you may consider
      novation.  </br></br> You should:</br> (i)     Assess the novation request and
      whether the new contractor is capable of undertaking the remaining services
      or supply of goods without any change in contractual terms.</br> (ii)    Put
      up a recommendation report to the original QAA/Tenders Board which approved
      the term contract to proceed with the novation if the new contractor is assessed
      to be suitable. </br> (iii)   Clear the “Novation Agreement” with Legal dept.
      The Novation Agreement shall be signed by 3 parties i.e. URA, the existing contractor
      and the new contractor. </br></br>  If the new contractor is not capable of
      undertaking the works, you may decide not to effect the novation and to terminate
      the contract according to the contract terms and conditions, and call a new
      tender to carry out the remaining services or supply of goods.
  utter_FAQ-novation required for new company name in existing contract:
  - text: The required action to be taken depends on what is meant by the “change
      in company name”, and whether the legal personality of the company has changed
      after the change in name. For example, if a person has changed his name, he
      is still the same person, and there is no change in the legal personality. Similarly,
      for a company that has changed its name but everything else about the company
      is retained and unchanged, there is no need for novation. A simple contract
      variation to account for the change in name will suffice in this case.</br></br>
      However, in some instances where company names are changed to signify a change
      in management or even the entire organisation, for example in cases of merger
      and acquisition, novation is necessary in order to transfer all legal liabilities
      of the existing contract to the new legal personality.
  utter_FAQ-debarment:
  - text: No. Debarment is serious and cuts off Government procurement opportunities
      for errant contractor. Hence, the IM only provides for debarment of higher value
      purchases procured via tender.
  utter_FAQ-expenditure approval for G+S exempted from IM Proc:
  - text: Goods & services under the exemption list are exempted from procurement
      approach and the subsequent stages. However, you still need to seek approval
      to incur expenditure.
  utter_FAQ-shorten minimum quotation opening period:
  - text: Yes, you can shorten the opening period by seek approval from CEO or DCEO
      if you have good reasons.  The period of quotation shall not be shortened after
      the Quotation Notice has been published or issued so that suppliers are not
      caught unaware of the change in opening period
  utter_FAQ-need report if not recommending no award:
  - text: There is still a need to put up quotation/tender report to seek approval
      for no award and to post award notice in GeBIZ to inform tenderers of the decision.
  utter_FAQ-vendor to commence work before approval of report:
  - text: Regardless of how urgent your needs are, you can only start work after Quotation
      Approving Authority (QAA) / Tender Approving Authority (TAA has approved your
      recommendation report. By commencing work before that, the role of QAA/TAA is
      undermined and controls are bypassed.
  utter_FAQ-preparing specifications:
  - text: (a) Avoid specifying brand names or product models, or otherwise state "or
      equivalent" if there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of
      describing the requirement.</br> (b) Refrain from taking specifications wholesale
      from suppliers</br> (c) Avoid “over-specs” (e.g. include unnecessary requirements)</br>

      \ the terms and conditions of the contract.  </br></br> For contracts with EPV\
      \ equal to or below $500,000: SD shall be waived.</br></br> For contracts with\

  utter_FAQ-changing Conditions of Contract (COC):
  - text: The COC are cleared by AGC, where there is a list of optional clauses which
      can be included or excluded, depending on the requirements. If there are other
      changes to the COC, please clear with Legal.
  utter_FAQ-guidelines on cap for limiting liabilities:
  - text: The default position should be to remain silent on the capping of liabilities.
      Remaining silent on the capping of damages and liabilities does not mean that
      the vendor bears unlimited risks. Leaving it silent just means that in the event
      of damages or liabilities, the amount that the vendor is liable for will be
      determined by the courts, depending on legal precedents and what is reasonable.</br></br>  If
      the line department assesses that it is necessary to set a cap on the liabilities,
      this has to be done after carefully analyzing the risks for that procurement.
      The effect of such a limitation clause is that the Government will be underwriting
      some of the contractor’s liability. In view that the risks involved for each
      procurement differs, it is not possible to set any “norms”.  Line department
      would also have to specify the limit based on the nature and value of the tender
      as well as the risks to URA in the event of a breach.  It is advisable that
      no dollar figure be quoted but a percentage of the contract value be stated
      as the limit to the contactor’s liabilities in the contract.
  utter_FAQ-disqualification of bids higher than EPV:
  - text: You should not automatically disqualify tenderers on the sole basis that
      bids exceeded EPV. Please continue to assess based on the evaluation criteria
      stated upfront. If the recommended bid is higher than EPV, you can seek approval
      to increase the EPV.
  utter_FAQ-considered procurement if collab with other govt agencies:
  - text: When GPEs collaborate with other GPEs, there is no intent of parties to
      form legal relations with each other. So procurement rules do not apply. GPEs
      can consider using email exchanges, notes/minutes of meeting or non-legalistic
      Memorandum of Understanding between GPEs to list down the roles, responsibilities,
      funding/manpower commitments and scope of the collaboration where necessary.
  utter_FAQ-minimum quotation opening period applicable to Request for Quotation:
  - text: No, the minimum quotation opening period is not applicable to RFQ. Nonetheless,
      the time given to the suppliers to respond to the RFQ must be of a reasonable
      period. If there is a minimum opening period specified in the framework agreement,
      please adhere to the contracted RFQ opening period. You should contact the contract
      administrator for clarifications on such contract terms.
  utter_FAQ-A49:
  - text: In this instance you can specify a lower financial category for each of
      the tenderers since your intent is to award to a panel of suppliers. You can
      consider using the average contract value based on an estimated panel size to
      gauge a suitable financial category.
  utter_FAQ-minimum number of suppliers to alert when publishing quotation/tender:
  - text: No, there is no minimum number of suppliers you need to alert. You should
      try to tap on the widest possible supplier base and alert as many as practicable.
  utter_FAQ-other platforms to conduct procurement:
  - text: No, GeBIZ remains the only platform for all government procurement to be
      performed, although we can use other platforms to further publicise the procurement
      opportunities.
  utter_FAQ-A52:
  - text: The purpose of alerting suppliers is to bring to attention a procurement
      opportunity which has already been published openly. You should try to alert
      as many suppliers as practicable after the invitation to quotation/tender has
      been published on GeBIZ. This is to avoid being seen as biased towards the notified
      suppliers.  While doing so, please ensure that the notified suppliers do not
      receive additional information on top of those already published in the quotation/tender
      in order to ensure fairness and transparency.
  utter_FAQ-A53:
  - text: For EPV up to $70,000, QAA is the approving authority to approve the use
      of Limited Quotation or Direct Contracting.</br></br> For EPV beyond $70,000,
      CEO/DCEO is the approving authority to approve the use of Limited Tender or

  utter_FAQ-approval to further reduce the minimum tender opening period:
  - text: In exceptional circumstances where there is extreme urgency to meet critical
      operational deadlines, the minimum period of tender may be reduced to not less
      than 10 days with prior approval of the CEO/DCEO, when it is due to the following
      situations:</br> (a) safety consideration; or</br> (b) it is in the general
      public interest.</br> (refer to <a target='_blank' href='https://intranet.mof.gov.sg/portal/IM/Themes/Procurement/Stage-4-Sourcing/Topics/TENDER-–-TENDER-OPENING-PERIOD.aspx'>IM

  utter_non GPA/FTA-covered tenders minimum tendering period:
  - text: Procurement which is not covered under GPA/FTA need not comply with the
      obligations in the international agreements, hence a minimum of 14 days is permitted.
      You must still give sufficient time for tenderers to submit a response to the
      tender.
  utter_FAQ-bringing forward tender closing date with all tenderers submitting their proposals:
  - text: No, you cannot do so.  This is because any of the x tenderers is entitled
      to submit a fresh proposal which replaces or overwrites the earlier one, as
      long as he does so before the tender closing date and time.
  utter_FAQ-waiving liquidated damages (LDs):
  - text: For consultancy services in construction projects, the department should,
      in general, not impose LDs on consultants listed under the Public Sector Panel
      of Consultants (PSPC) for all disciplines, including quantity surveying and
      project management services.  This is because consultants are typically engaged
      ahead of the construction phase and usually with some float time available.
      Consultants' performance also depends on when and how the department engages
      them. It is often not possible to ascertain if project delays can be specifically
      attributed to the consultants for construction projects.   Additionally, it
      is also the industry norm not to impose LDs on construction consultancy tenders.
  utter_FAQ-deciding if qualified bids should be allowed:
  - text: You should consider the type of goods/services they are procuring and the
      nature of the industry. For example, when purchasing commercial-off-the-shelf
      items where evaluation is fairly straightforward and usually based solely on
      price, and where it is expected that there could be numerous tenderers, allowing
      for qualified bids may not be necessary. However, where the nature of the purchase
      is complex and it is expected that our standard terms and conditions may not
      fully address certain industry terms and conditions, allowing for qualified
      bids can be considered. </br></br> If there are any requirements or clauses
      which are deemed essential, it should be made clear in the quotation/tender
      documents that these are mandatory and not to be varied by the tenderer. Proposals
      which vary such essential requirements should then be deemed as invalid and
      excluded from further evaluation. Examples of requirements or clauses which
      may be considered as essential could include tender validity, applicable law,
      IP ownership etc.
  utter_FAQ-differentiating tenderers with different qualification degrees/aspects of the Tender:
  - text: If qualified bids are allowed, you should make clear in the evaluation criteria
      how variations made by the Tenderer will be evaluated and how it will take into
      account any additional risk or cost to URA as a result of the qualifications.  For
      example, it must be made clear to tenderers that proposals with variations to
      the Conditions of Contracts may be scored lower compared to proposals that are
      fully compliant, and those with qualifications that give rise to substantial
      impact to URA would be scored lower than those that do not. </br></br> Tenderers
      can also be instructed to explicitly provide additional cost, for full compliance
      to the Tender clauses so you are able to make a better assessment of the trade-offs.
  utter_FAQ-invoking of Limited Tender during extreme urgency:
  - text: Extreme urgency refers to situations or events that are beyond the reasonable
      contemplation of agencies or which occur suddenly, and the timing of the intended
      procurement has impact to the proper functioning of the Government. Some examples
      include unexpected situations which has impact on public health, public safety,
      national or homeland security; Or disruptions of on-going contracts due to unexpected
      default by contractors. However, this ground should not be used loosely, for
      example, to justify internal deadlines due to a lack of planning or delays by
      the department in calling the procurements.
  utter_FAQ-request tenderers to extend their offer validity more than once:
  - text: The IM on Procurement does not stipulate a cap on the number of extensions.
      Nevertheless, departments should request for further extensions only if they
      have reasonable grounds to do so, as tenderers are under no obligation to agree
      to their request for extension of tender/quotation validity period beyond what
      the departments have specified for in the ITQ/ITT, as these are commercial decisions.
  utter_FAQ-bid amendment:
  - text: In the event that any errors (including omissions) are discovered during
      evaluation and after the quotation/tender has closed, the erroneous bid may
      be corrected with the approval of the Approving Officer (Bid Amendment). Departments
      have to assess that the following conditions are met before a bid amendment
      can be considered:</br> a) It is a genuine error; and</br> b) It does not give
      rise to discriminatory or unfair practices.</br></br>  In assessing whether
      there is a genuine error, Departments can consider if there are supporting indications
      that suggest that there is likely to be a genuine error. </br></br> Also, please
      note that omitted factual documents can be accepted via clarifications and approval
      for bid amendment is not necessary. Refer to flowchart below to determine if
      approval for bid amendment is required and the appropriate Approving Officer
      (Bid Amendment)
  utter_FAQ-level of approval for bid amendment:
  - text: The bid amendments have to be approved by the following Approving Officer
      (Bid Amendment) before seeking approval of award for the quotation/tender. </br></br>
      a) CEO</br> For pricing alterations</br></br>  b) DCEO</br> For non-pricing
      alterations (e.g. to accept non-factual documents that were omitted in the proposal
      for further evaluation)</br></br>  c) Dir (Finance)</br> For pricing alterations
      due to genuine errors that can be verified against the supporting documents
      (e.g. typo errors, calculation errors)
  utter_FAQ-using bid amendment to correct bid error:
  - text: The following must be met before a bid amendment could be considered:</br>
      a) It is a genuine error; and</br> b) It does not give rise to discriminatory
      or unfair practices.</br></br>  Whether the bid amendment affects a tenderer’s
      compliance with any criterion, even if it is a critical criterion, is immaterial.
  utter_FAQ-tenderer doesn't provide evidence to support error was genuine:
  - text: If the department cannot ascertain that there is a genuine error or assessed
      that the bid amendment should not be carried out, there is no need to consider
      doing bid amendments.</br></br>  In such cases, the department may evaluate
      the proposal based on the tenderer’s original bid.
  utter_FAQ-A66:
  - text: Approval from AO(Bid Amendment) is not required to rectify the nominal bid
      price on GeBIZ as there is no actual amendment made to the bid price. However,
      Departments must highlight the details of the correction in the quotation/tender
      report. Finance will correct the nominal bid price on GeBIZ.</br></br>  If there
      are price discrepancies between a tenderer’s price on GeBIZ and their attached
      documents, and there are doubts on which is the correct bid price, Departments
      should seek clarification from the tenderer.</br></br>  Departments can try
      to minimise the occurrence of tenderers placing nominal bid prices on GeBIZ
      by having clear instructions in the ITQ/ITT and reducing the number of line
      items on GeBIZ, where feasible.
  utter_FAQ-A67:
  - text: Departments may accept the clarifications provided that it does not give
      rise to unfair practices (e.g. preferential treatment given only to selected
      tenderers). Approval from AO (Bid Amendment) is not required. However, the withdrawal
      of qualification will still need to be highlighted in the quotation/tender report.</br></br>  The
      intent of having a single set of COC/requirements for the quotation/tender is
      to ensure that tenderers could compete fairly on a level playing field. If the
      tenderer agrees to withdraw the qualifications after clarification, it brings
      their bid back to a level playing field which is in compliance with the COC/requirements.
  utter_FAQ-bid amendment required to correct error of tenderer not meeting all requirements:
  - text: Approval for bid amendment is not required. However, Departments will still
      need to seek clarification with the tenderer on why they had indicated non-compliance
      to ensure that the tenderers had submitted their bid proposals with an accurate
      understanding of the requirements in the ITQ/ITT. The details of the clarification
      are to be included in the quotation/tender report.
  utter_FAQ-difference between 2-Stage tendering and negotiations:
  - text: In 2-Stage tendering, there is no negotiation involved.  The revisions to
      the tender specifications or terms are initiated by the department. Essentially
      the department decides on what to be revised and all eligible tenderers are
      required to submit their new bids which have to comply fully with the revised
      tender.
  utter_FAQ-unauthorized officer signs contract:
  - text: In law, only officers authorized under the Government Contract are authorized
      to bind the Government to legal agreements.  A person who purports to bind the
      Government to a legal transaction which he is not authorized to do would be
      personally liable to the other contracting party for any liability arising out
      of that agreement.
  utter_FAQ-date of award taken as date of establishing contract:
  - text: The Award Notice is published for the public’s information. URA still needs
      to communicate the award to the successful supplier(s) via a contracting instrument.
      It is only reasonable that the successful supplier(s) know the result of the
      award before or, at the very least, the same time as the public. The date of
      tender/quotation authority’s approval is internal within URA and is usually
      before the contracting instrument is given to the successful supplier(s). So,
      publishing the Award Notice 3 days from tender/quotation approval date would
      potentially be informing the award decision to the public before the successful
      supplier(s).
  utter_FAQ-case for debarment when terminating contract:
  - text: If it is the department who wants to terminate the contract and the contractor
      has not defaulted in its contractual performance, then there is no need to put
      up the case for debarment.
  utter_FAQ-terminating a contract:
  - text: For termination according to specific terms in contract, please seek CEO’s
      approval.</br> For reasons other than the violating of the contract terms, Legal
      must be consulted on proposed termination. If termination is in order, you can
      then seek approval from original QAA (for quotation value contract) or TAA(for
      tender value contract).
  utter_FAQ-contractor submit own quotes for star rate works:
  - text: The guiding principle when receiving quotations for star rate works, besides
      getting value for money (VfM), is to ensure that there is no conflict of interest
      when the contractor carrying out the works also submits his own quotes. The
      contractor can call 3 quotes if he does not participate in the quotation. However,
      if the contractor decides to participate in the quotation, the consultant shall
      assist URA to obtain 3 separate quotes and ensure that the star rate item is
      valued at fair market rate.
  utter_FAQ-guidelines for proprietary products:
  - text: For proprietary products, it is acceptable to use a star rate based on sole
      supplier’s invoice/quotation. Generally, only quotations which are reasonable
      and reflective of market prices should be considered. Quotations which are extreme
      in value should not be considered. The consultants shall exercise discretion
      and professional judgement to sieve out quotations deemed not reflective of
      market prices. </br></br> Proper records shall be kept on the above and forwarded
      to the contracting agency for retention and reference.
  utter_FAQ-A74:
  - text: There is no fixed quantum on what constitutes the bulk or substantial percentage
      of works done using star rates. The departments will have to exercise their
      judgement, taking into consideration if it is in the best interest to carry
      out the works as star rate items. Some factors to consider include if there
      are project-specific factors (e.g. site limitations may not allow another contractor
      to work concurrently) and if the government is getting value for money in going
      for star rates.
  utter_FAQ-key principles of Government Procurement:
  - text: The three key principles of Government Procurement are:</br> (a) Open and
      Fair Competition - Provide fair access opportunities to suppliers to compete
      on a level playing field</br> (b) Transparency - Make known procurement objectives,
      criteria and procedures to suppliers</br> (c) Value for Money (VFM) - Procure
      from suppliers who can best meet requirements while offering best value and
      VFM does not necessarily mean awarding to the lowest bidder
  utter_FAQ-GeBIZ:
  - text: GeBIZ is one-stop business centre for suppliers to access business opportunities
      and transact with the Government. All procurement shall be made through GeBIZ,
      other than the exceptions as follows:</br> (a) when GPEs make Small Value Purchase;
      or</br> (b) when the procurement is from a sole supplier that is not a GeBIZ
      Trading Partner (GTP) ; or</br> (c) where the context of the Intended GP cannot
      be supported by the use of GeBIZ (e.g. technological constraints or market peculiarities)

      You need to assess whether the price quoted is reasonable. This may be based
      on recent purchases, verbal or written quotes, or any source of reliable information.
      You do not have to source for three quotes.
  utter_FAQ-star rate items:
  - text: It is typical in some contracts, such as term contracts for facilities management,
      additions and alterations works or construction contracts, for the contract
      to be structured based on a Schedule of Rates (SOR). The SOR lists the unit
      prices of items needed for the works. As and when works are required, the cost
      of the works is extracted from and built up according to the unit prices listed
      in the SOR.  However, certain items may not be listed in the contract’s SOR.
      These are typically known as “star rate” items.
  utter_FAQ-late hardcopy tender submission:
  - text: Whether the hardcopy submission is late, you have to ensure that the acceptance
      of late hard copy submission does not give rise to unfair practices.  </br></br>
      You should consider whether the information submitted via the hardcopy submission
      affects the prices or the proposal submitted via GeBIZ. If the hardcopy submissions
      are merely supporting documents which contain factual information (e.g. financial
      statements), there should not be any concerns as tenderers are not able to modify
      the late submission to their advantage (e.g. to further refine their proposal
      with the additional time or after having knowledge of the bids published on
      GeBIZ).  </br></br> The best way to avoid such situation is to mandate a full
      electronic submission whenever possible.

      communicate outcome-based requirements. Therefore, RFP is not as specific as
      tender specifications and allow for some flexibility and diversity in proposals
      submitted. However, evaluation of proposals would be more challenging and tenders
