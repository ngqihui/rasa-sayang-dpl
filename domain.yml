  - text: Hello! I’m Procurement Chatbot and still in beta testing. I can provide
      advisory services on how to carry out procurement of your required goods and
      services. There are few ways to interact with me. Want to see a brief tutorial
      of what I can do?
  utter_intro_yes:
  - text: Awesome! I will guide you through the procurement cycle from Stage 1 to
      8. You can also access specific stages quickly by using the links at the top.
  utter_intro_no:
  - text: "There are 8 stages of the procurement cycle. Please select the procurement\
      \ stage you are interested in, or you can start from Stage 1 to go through the\
      \ entire procurement cycle. \nbuttons:  - title: \"Step 1: Establishing Needs\"\
      \ payload: '/step1'"
  utter_stage_1:
  - text: The first step of the procurement process is to establish that there is
      a genuine need for the procurement. You are encouraged to conduct proper market
      research (e.g. seeking budgetary quotes) for better product knowledge and market
      awareness, so as to determine the Estimated Procurement Value (EPV) and adopt
      suitable sourcing methods thereafter.
  utter_stage_2_main:
  - text: 'Demand Aggregation (DA) contracts should be used for: (a) Recurring purchases
      required on a regular basis (i.e. not one-off purchase), regardless of value;
      (b) Food catering services (both ad-hoc and recurring); and (c) Services available
      under the mandatory DA contracts. It is not mandatory to check against DA contracts
      before buying via Small Value Purchase (SVP), though you can still check it
      as a means of market survey or for cost benchmarking.'

  - text: You can do a search on GeBIZ <https://ngg.intranet.gebiz.gov.sg> for the
      Whole-of-Government (WOG) DA contracts by typing the relevant keywords of the
      item in the main search bar. There are WOG DA contracts for food catering, hiring
      of buses, booking of event venues and comms campaigns etc. You should also check
      if there are any URA period contracts <https://uranium2.ura.gov.sg/sites/Tools_and_Resources/Corporate/Finance%20and%20Procurement/Pages/URA-Period-Contracts.aspx>
      that may meet your needs (e.g. printing of corporate materials and subscription
      services). If applicable, do contact the contract administrator for further
      details. Refer to the  <a target='_blank' href='https://uranium2.ura.gov.sg/sites/Tools_and_Resources/Corporate/Finance%20and%20Procurement/Documents/Procurement%20Guide/Guide%20on%20Checking%20for%20Demand%20Aggregation%20%28DA%29%20and%20URA%20period%20contracts.pdf'>"Guide
      on checking for Demand Aggregation (DA) and URA period contracts"</a> for step-by-step
      guide to check whether your intended procurement is covered under the WOG DA
      contracts or URA period contracts. Did you manage to find a WOG DA contract
      or URA period contract that suits your needs?

  - text: DA contracts can be in the form of (i) Period Contract or (ii) Framework
      Agreement  Let me help you to find out which category is relevant to you. For
      the goods and/or services you require, are the rates fixed or defined for the
      contractual period?

      DA / URA period contracts and address the following in the expenditure paper:
      (i) Highlight that there is an existing DA / URA period contract; (ii) Justify
      why you are not using the DA / URA period contract; (iii) Indicate the price
      differential for awarding own contract (versus leveraging on the established
